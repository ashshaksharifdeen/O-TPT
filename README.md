# O-TPT: Orthogonality Constraints for Calibrating Test-time Prompt Tuning in Vision-Language Models (CVPR 2025) 

Our contributions are summarized as follows:
  - We provide new insights underlying the suboptimal performance of an existing top-performing calibration method for test-time prompt tuning
  - We propose a novel approach (named `O-TPT`) for calibrating test-time prompt tuning for VLMs by enforcing orthogonality constraints. This is accomplished by introducing orthogonal regularization on the textual features.

  - We perform an extensive evaluation to validate our approach on various datasets and across different baselines. Results reveal that `O-TPT` provides consistent gains over the state-of-the-art methods in overall average calibration performance with several different baselines. Moreover, our `O-TPT` provides better calibration performance than the zero-shot CLIP which reveals improved calibration compared to existing SOTA (include-picture below).
